While performing any ML classification problem we have to try and apply multiple ML algorithm to check which model is giving us the good sort of accuracy.

In this notebook we have performed a short and effective method which will save your time for cross validation so that you can spend more time on the model configuration or Hyper-Parameter Tuning.


# Run all classification models at a time.
from lazypredict.Supervised import LazyClassifier
#sklearn prebuilt dataset
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
data = load_breast_cancer()
x = data.data
y = data.target
#splitting the data
x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x,y,test_size = 0.3,random_state = 42)

clf = LazyClassifier(verbose = 0, ignore_warnings =True, custom_metric = None)

models,predictions = clf.fit(x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test)
#getting the outputs
print(models)
